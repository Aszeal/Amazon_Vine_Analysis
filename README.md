# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
I was tasked by a company called SellBy to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.

## Results 
- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  - There were 40,565 reviews.
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  - For Vine reviwers there were 48 5 star ratings.
  - For  Non-Vine reviewers there were 15,663 5 star ratings.
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  - Fro Vine reviewers the percentage is 51%.
  - For Non-Vine reviewers the percentage is 38%.
  
 ## Summary
 After investigating my results I cannot conclusively say that there is a positive bias towards leaving more positive reviews; if you are a user of Vine products. What I can say is that compared to non-vine users, it is strange that the percentage is much higher. I think a more in-depth analysis is need to better support the claim of postive baisness. Another analysis that could be conducted is comparing the negative review percentages. That might gives us some insight into what some customers think of the product's faults.
